The product of all positive real values of x satisfying the equation x(16(log<sub>5</sub>x)<sup>3</sup>−68log<sub>5</sub>x)=5<sup>-16</sup> is

JEE Advanced 2022 (Paper 2)




Solution:

Taking log to the base 5
 on both sides

(16(log5x)3−68(log5x))(log5x)=−16
Let (log5x)=t
16t4−68t2+16=0
⇒4t4−16t2−t2+4=0
⇒(4t2−1)(t2−4)=0
⇒t=±12,±2
So log5x=±12
 or ±2
⇒x=512, 5−12, 52, 5−2
Hence, the product is 5–√×15√×25×125=1
